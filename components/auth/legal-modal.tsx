                  By creating a trade account, submitting a procurement request, accepting a quotation or otherwise instructing us to proceed with an order, the customer agrees to these Terms of Trade.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  JDMHUB provides a commercial procurement and logistics coordination service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unless expressly stated otherwise in a quotation, parts may be sourced from independent third-party suppliers overseas. Autohub does not manufacture those parts and does not independently warrant their manufacture, quality or conformity beyond any warranty expressly provided by Autohub or passed through from the relevant supplier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will use reasonable commercial efforts to source parts matching the information and requirements supplied by the customer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Unless otherwise stated, quotations are valid for <strong>48 hours</strong> and remain subject to supplier availability and final supplier confirmation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prices are stated in New Zealand Dollars (NZD) and will specify whether GST, freight, customs charges and other applicable costs are included.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where a quotation is stated as a <strong>Total Landed Door-to-Door Price</strong>, that price includes the items expressly identified in the quotation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If an exceptional cost arises after acceptance that could not reasonably have been identified when the quotation was issued — including changes in government duties, taxes, regulatory charges or customer-requested changes — we will notify the customer before charging any additional amount wherever reasonably practicable.

                  The customer is responsible for providing accurate information required to identify the requested part, including where applicable the VIN, registration, model, year, engine specification, OEM part number, photographs and any other requested information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Autohub will use reasonable commercial efforts to verify part compatibility using the information available to it and its suppliers.

                <p>
                  Unless expressly confirmed in writing, <strong>fitment and compatibility are not guaranteed</strong>.

                </p>

                  The customer must review the description, photographs, part numbers and other information contained in the quotation before accepting the order.

                  Autohub is not responsible for loss, damage or failure arising from incorrect installation, modification, programming, calibration, misuse or failure to follow applicable installation procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where reasonably practicable, any apparent defect, damage or discrepancy should be reported before the part is installed or modified.

                <p>
                  If a part is materially different from the part confirmed in the accepted quotation, arrives materially damaged in transit, or is demonstrably defective, the customer must notify us through JDMHUB as soon as reasonably practicable and preferably within <strong>7 business days of delivery</strong>, together with photographs and other reasonable supporting evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where a valid claim is established, Autohub will use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain an appropriate remedy from the supplier or carrier, which may include repair, replacement, credit or refund depending on the circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any manufacturer&apos;s or supplier&apos;s warranty available in relation to a part will, where reasonably possible, be passed through to the customer.

                <p>
                  Where goods are delivered visibly damaged, the customer should note the damage on the delivery record where reasonably possible and promptly notify Autohub.

                <p>
                  Title to goods supplied by Autohub does not pass to the customer until all amounts owing in respect of those goods have been paid in full.

                  The customer authorises Autohub and its logistics providers to use the transport method, packaging, documentation and handling procedures reasonably required to comply with those requirements.

                  Once a quotation has been accepted and Autohub has committed to the supplier, purchased the goods or commenced international logistics, the order <strong>cannot ordinarily be cancelled or changed</strong>.
